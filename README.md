# Heart Disease Prediction Web Application

# Project Overview
The aim is to build a heart disease classifier and model deployment on the web. TO train the model we use [Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease?resource=download) dataset from kaggle. This project uses Flask API and Heroku to deploy the model and build the web application.
